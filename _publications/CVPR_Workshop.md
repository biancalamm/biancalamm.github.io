In this paper, we describe a first publicly available fine-grained product recognition dataset based on leaflet images. Using advertisement leaflets, collected over several
years from different European retailers, we provide a total of 41.6k manually annotated product images in 832 classes. Further, we investigate three different approaches for this
fine-grained product classification task, Classification by Image, by Text, as well as by Image and Text. The approach ”Classification by Text” uses the text extracted
directly from the leaflet product images. We show, that the combination of image and text as input improves the classification of visual difficult to distinguish products. The
final model leads to an accuracy of 96.4% with a Top-3 score of 99.2%.
