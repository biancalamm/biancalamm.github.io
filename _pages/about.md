I am a doctoral candidate at [Promotionsverband Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg](https://www.promotionsverband-bw.de/). I am conducting my research at the [Institute of Machine Learning and Analytics](https://imla.hs-offenburg.de/) at [Offenburg University](https://www.hs-offenburg.de/en/) in Germany.
My supervisor is [Janis Keuper](https://www.keuper-labs.org/members/janis.html).
I hold a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Mathematics from the [Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hft-stuttgart.com/) in Germany.

I work on Computer Vision and Foundation Models.<br>
It would be my pleasure to collaborate on interesting topics within these domains ðŸ˜€!
