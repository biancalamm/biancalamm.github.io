I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Machine Learning and Analytics](https://imla.hs-offenburg.de/), part of the [Offenburg University](https://www.hs-offenburg.de/en/) in Germany.
My PhD advisor is [Janis Keuper](https://www.keuper-labs.org/members/janis.html).
I have a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mathematics from the [Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hft-stuttgart.com/) in Germany.

It would be my pleasure to collaborate on interesting topics within these domains ðŸ˜€!
